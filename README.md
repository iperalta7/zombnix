# Project Z - A Zombie Wave RPG

When launching this game, you will be greeted with the main menu screen,
from which you can play the game. After selecting a character, the game 
screen will open up. To move the player around, you use the W A S D keys
on your keyboard. The player starts with 100 health and will be chased by
zombies. To shoot the zombies, a player must have a gun selected and press 
the space bar on the keyboard. The zombies deal 10 damage to the player 
and give the player 10 points when killed. These points can be used in the
shop which opens by pressing the letter P. The inventory can be opened by 
pressing the E key. The user has the ability to swap items from their 
locations, and these changes are reflected in the hot bar slots on the 
game screen.
